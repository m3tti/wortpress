# WortPress
A simple web minimal blog engine. The goal is to just provide the totally necessary stuff 
to get the word out. The main workflow for wortpress is.

1. Create admin user with `bb -m commands.user/create-admin <email> <password>`
2. Go to `http://localhost:8080/login` and log in
3. Go to settings `http://localhost:8080/setting` and chose *primary* color, *secondary* color and *font* (from google fonts)
4. Go to posts `http://localhost:8080/post` and start writing.
